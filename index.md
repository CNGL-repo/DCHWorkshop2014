#Workshop on Language Technologies &amp; Digital Cultural Heritage

Facilitator: Alexander O’Connor <Alex.OConnor@scss.tcd.ie>

##Abstract
A common challenge in the area of Language Technologies is the need to find data and questions to apply novel solutions to. A significant methodological question is raised when researchers define the problem, collect the data and assess the results themselves. In order to combat this, there has been a move towards the use of open science, shared tasks, and engagement with other academic communities to empower their scholarship.
It is these themes which this workshop will focus on: Digital Cultural Heritage can provide Data, Questions and (automatic and manual) Validation. How can some of the current work in CNGL be applied to some example problems and questions?

##Proposed Agenda
The workshop is proposed to run for __75 minutes__.

The proposed format for the event is to break out into groups of five people , and for each group
 to examine one or more data sources, projects and problems and see if they can come up with a research proposal based on [this template](https://github.com/CNGL-repo/DCHWorkshop2014/blob/master/Documents/template.md).
