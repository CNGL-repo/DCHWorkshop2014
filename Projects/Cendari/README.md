# Relationship to Language Technology
The project seeks to use natural language processing to help annotate historical resources at an _entity_ level: reflecting semantic background knowledge. This is to facilitate broader search (for example by automatically reconciling cross-cultural and diachronic variations in entity labels), and better, richer sharing of content.

# Outputs
1. A research environment that includes rich semantic annotation, with semi-automatic support.
2. An ontological representation of archives, historical background knowledge and related concepts
3. A set of actively-curated research guides
4. A service infrastructure to support the above.
